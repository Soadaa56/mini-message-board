# mini-message-board
An assignment project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to get more comfortable with NodeJS and Express.
[Project: Mini Message Board](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-mini-message-board)

The first in what should be 3 or 4 assignments I will complete before moving onto my own personal project.

I will say the contrast is quite interesting between Ruby on Rails and JSNode with Express. I think I prefer the opionated approach of Rails.
So far (which is just scratching the surface) I can apperciate how certain parts of 'Rails magic' works, or in other words what it simplifies for you.
Such as settings Routes and how the MVC functions is fairly similar but the syntax is far lighter with Rails.
